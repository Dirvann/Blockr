 * Our current implementation does not allow to test this without opening a window.

 * 	1. Make a class that can recieve input in between the key events and the presentation class.
 *  2. Everything needs to be independent of canvas for testing. 
 *  	I should be able to use the class from (1) and block locations to test without the GUI.
